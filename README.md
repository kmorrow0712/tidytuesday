My humble works for [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). R is cool ya'll! Especially if you utilize tidyverse.

My goal here is to learn something with each entry and push my ability to creatively visualize data.

### Hats off to:
1. All of the lovely submissions I see every week!
2. Joey Stanley for creating the beautiful [Future Visions](https://github.com/JoeyStanley/futurevisions) color palettes
